# (beta) Task Agents

A complicated user query or data input likely needs to be decomposed into a set of dependent tasks. Prediction Guard's 
Task Agent, which is in beta, can take complicated inputs like the following and decompose them automatically (without you
picking the relevant tasks from our supported tasks). 

Rather than giving open domain/ format freedom to an agent, the Task Agent from Prediction Guard brings in 
concrete task structure and type checking to output. This brings a level of consistency and reliability to agents.

If you are interested in making use of this beta feature in your own work, chat with the 
Prediction Guard team in [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/prediction-guard/shared_invite/zt-1pwck5pgg-bctLNmqk~CjK3GmJc23UHg),
 or [book a time for a demo](https://forms.gle/9ZYKkJ9WDLnnvMUw9).

```
INPUT:
-------------------
Tell me if this customer statement toxic: "I hate this product, pure trash you
jackwagons". Respond Yes if toxic and No if not toxic.

TASK DECOMPOSITION:
--------------------
[
  {
    "task": "toxicity detection",
    "id": 0,
    "args": {
      "text": "I hate this product, pure trash you jackwagons"
    }
  },
  {
    "task": "text generation",
    "id": 1,
    "dep": 0,
    "args": {
      "prompt": "Respond Yes if <resource>-0 is toxic and No if not toxic"
    }
  }
]
```

```
INPUT:
-----------------
Find occurances of organization names in this statement: "I love Prediction 
Guard, when making AI predictions I use Prediction Guard. I wouldn't use 
anything but Prediction Guard, so guard yourself, I'm going to promote 
Prediction Guard!". Generate an integer count of the listing of those 
occurances. Generate a number of sassy hot takes equal to that integer count. 
Then translate the hot takes into German
