# Guarded Chatbot

Create a custom domain chatbot with checks for factuality, toxicity, and consistency.

This example will be posted soon. [Contact us in Slack](../support) if you have this or other related use cases. We want to make sure you can build amazing LLM applications with Prediction Guard!

## Installation and Setup
- Install the package requirements by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Get a Prediction Guard access token (as described [here](https://docs.predictionguard.com/)) and set it as the environment variable `PREDICTIONGUARD_TOKEN`.
## Running the Chatbot
- To use the chatbot, first define the `PREDICTIONGUARD_TOKEN` environment variable, then run `streamlit run chat.py`.
- The chatbot will automatically open in your browser, but if it does not, the terminal will output the URL for the app.
- Any errors that the chatbot has will print out in both the app and the terminal, so you can monitor an issues more easily.
