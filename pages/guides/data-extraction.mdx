# Data extraction example with factuality checks

This guide demonstrates the extraction of patient information from simulated doctor-patient transcripts. The extracted information is validated using a the [factual consistency checks](../reference/factuality) from Prediction Guard. The example focuses on the first 5 rows of a Kaggle dataset containing example simulated doctor-patient transcripts.

## Load the data 

Download the data from this [json file](pages/usingllms/transcript_data/transcripts.json). You can then use the code below to load the necessary libraries and the dataset from the above mentioned JSON file. The code converts the data into a Pandas DataFrame and selects the first 5 rows for testing.

```python copy
import json
import itertools

import pandas as pd
from langchain import PromptTemplate
import predictionguard as pg


os.environ["PREDICTIONGUARD_TOKEN"] = "<your access token>"

# Load the JSON data into a dataframe
data = []
with open('transcripts.json') as f:
    for line in itertools.islice(f, 5):
        line = line.strip()
        if not line: continue
        data.append(json.loads(line))
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Transform rows to columns
df = df.transpose()

# Reset the index and assign an index column
df = df.reset_index()
df.columns = ['id', 'transcript']

# Reset the index (optional)
df.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)

# Start with 5 rows of the dataframe
df=df.head(5)
```

## Summarize the data

When processing uniquely formatted, unstructured text with LLMs, it is sometimes useful to summarize the input text into a coherent and well-structured paragraph. The code below defines a prompt for summarization, creates a prompt template using LangChain, and uses the `Nous-Hermes-Llama2-13B` to generate summaries for each transcript. The generated summaries are added as a new column in the DataFrame, and we save them to a CSV file (in case we want them later).


```python copy
# Define the summarization prompt
summarize_template = """### Instruction:
Summarize the input transcript below.

### Input:
{transcript}

### Response:
"""

summary_prompt = PromptTemplate(template=summarize_template,
    input_variables=["context"],
)

# Loop over the rows summarizing the data
summaries = []
for i,row in df.iterrows():
    result=pg.Completion.create(
        model="Nous-Hermes-Llama2-13B",
        prompt=summary_prompt.format(
            transcript=row['transcript']
        ),
        max_tokens=200,
        temperature=0.1
    )
    print(result['choices'][0]['text'])
    summaries.append(result['choices'][0]['text'])

# Print out some summaries to sanity check them
df['summary']=summaries
print(df.head(5))

# Save the resulting data
df.to_csv("summarized_transcripts.csv", index=False)
```
## Extract Information and Perform Factuality Checks

We can now create a question answering prompt and prompt template to perform the information extraction. This prompt template can be re-used to answer relevant questions from the data - symptoms, Patient name, when the symptom started, level of pain the patient is experiencing, etc.

```python copy
# Define the questions we want answered
questions=["What symptoms is the patient experiencing",
           "What is the Patient's name?",
           "When did the symptoms start?",
           "On a scale of 1 to 10, what level of pain is the patient experiencing?"]

# Define the question answering prompt
question_answer_template = """### Instruction:
Answer the following question {question} using the below doctor-patient transcript summary.

### Input:
{transcript_summary}

### Response:
"""

q_and_a_prompt = PromptTemplate(template=question_answer_template,
    input_variables=["question", "transcript_summary"],
)
```

Factuality checks are crucial for evaluating the accuracy of information provided by the language model, especially when dealing with high risk data. Prediction Guard leverages state-of-the-art models for factual consistency checks, ensuring the reliability of outputs in reference to the context of the prompts. Thus, after we prompt the model with each question, we evaluate the responses against the corresponding transcript summaries. Factuality scores are generated to assess the accuracy of the answers.

```python copy
answers = {q: [] for q in questions}
fact_scores = {q: [] for q in questions}

# Loop over the rows of the dataframe processing each transcript
for i, row in df.iterrows():
    for q in questions:

        # Extract the information
        result = pg.Completion.create(
            model="Nous-Hermes-Llama2-13B",
            prompt=q_and_a_prompt.format(
                question=q, transcript_summary=row["summary"]
            ),
            max_tokens=200,
            temperature=0.1,

        )

        # Generate a factual consistency score
        fact_score = pg.Factuality.check(
            reference=row['summary'],
            text=result['choices'][0]['text']
        )

        # Append the results
        fact_scores[q].append(fact_score['checks'][0]['score'])
        answers[q].append(result["choices"][0]["text"])

# Add the answers and fact scores as new columns to the original DataFrame
for q in questions:
    df[f"{q}_answer"] = answers[q]
    df[f"{q}_fact_score"] = fact_scores[q]

# Show some results
print(df.head(2))

# Save the results
df.to_csv("answers_with_fact_scores.csv", index=False)
```

You can also call the factual consistency checking functionality directly using the [`/factuality`](../reference/factuality) endpoint, which will enable you to configure thresholds and score arbitrary inputs.
