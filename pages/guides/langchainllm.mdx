title: LangChain LLM Wrapper

# Using Prediction Guard proxies in LangChain

[LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) is one of the most popular AI projects, and for good reason! LangChain
helps you "Build applications with LLMs through composability." LangChain doesn't host LLMs or provide a standardized API for controlling LLMs, which is addressed by Prediction Guard. Therefore, combining the two (Prediction Guard + LangChain) gives you **a framework for developing controlled and compliant applications powered by language models.**

## Installation and Setup
- Install the Python SDK with `pip install predictionguard`
- Get an Prediction Guard access token (as described [here](https://docs.predictionguard.com/)) and set it as an environment variable (`PREDICTIONGUARD_TOKEN`)

## LLM Wrapper

There exists a Prediction Guard LLM wrapper, which you can access with 
```python
from langchain.llms import PredictionGuard
```

You can provide the name of the Prediction Guard model as an argument when initializing the LLM:
```python
pgllm = PredictionGuard(model="Nous-Hermes-Llama2-13B")
```

You can also provide your access token directly as an argument:
```python
pgllm = PredictionGuard(model="Nous-Hermes-Llama2-13B", token="<your access token>")
```

Finally, you can provide an "output" argument that is used to validate the output of the LLM:
```python
pgllm = PredictionGuard(model="Nous-Hermes-Llama2-13B", output={"toxicity": True})
```

## Example usage

Basic usage of the controlled or guarded LLM wrapper:
```python
import os

import predictionguard as pg
from langchain.llms import PredictionGuard
from langchain import PromptTemplate, LLMChain

# Your Prediction Guard API key. Get one at predictionguard.com
os.environ["PREDICTIONGUARD_TOKEN"] = "<your Prediction Guard access token>"

# Define a prompt template
template = """Respond to the following query based on the context.

Context: EVERY comment, DM + email suggestion has led us to this EXCITING announcement! ðŸŽ‰ We have officially added TWO new candle subscription box options! ðŸ“¦

Query: {query}

Result: """
prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=["query"])

# With "guarding" or controlling the output of the LLM. See the 
# Prediction Guard docs (https://docs.predictionguard.com) to learn how to 
# control the output with integer, float, boolean, JSON, and other types and
# structures.
pgllm = PredictionGuard(model="Nous-Hermes-Llama2-13B")
pgllm(prompt.format(query="What kind of post is this?"))
```

Basic LLM Chaining with the Prediction Guard wrapper:
```python
import os

from langchain import PromptTemplate, LLMChain
from langchain.llms import PredictionGuard

# Your Prediction Guard API key. Get one at predictionguard.com
os.environ["PREDICTIONGUARD_TOKEN"] = "<your Prediction Guard access token>"

pgllm = PredictionGuard(model="Nous-Hermes-Llama2-13B")

template = """Question: {question}

Answer: Let's think step by step."""
prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=["question"])
llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=pgllm, verbose=True)

question = "What NFL team won the Super Bowl in the year Justin Beiber was born?"

llm_chain.predict(question=question)
```
