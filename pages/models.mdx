# Available Models

Using Prediction Guard gives you quick and easy access to 100's of state-of-the-art AI models, without you needing to spend
days and weeks figuring out all of the implementation details, managing a bunch of API keys, and setting up the infrastructure
for model deployments. 

However, the convenience doesn't stop there. You can stop worrying about which particular model you are using on the backend 
altogether, because Prediction Guard's [automated (and continuously monitored) model selection](/#3-create-your-first-proxy-inference-endpoint) ensures that you are 
using the best model for your particular use case. It then proxies that model, such that you can acces it with 
a standardized API (no OpenAI, co:here, etc. keys needed).  

All that said, your boss is probably asking you: 

> Are you using ChatGPT yet? Is that something I can tell our customers?

So to help you tell the story of which models you have access to through Prediction Guard and to give you confidence that
