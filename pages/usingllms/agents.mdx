# Agents

Prompts, chaining, and prompt engineering is important. However, you might not always know what chain or prompts you need to execute prior to receiving user input or new data. This is where automation and **agents** can help. This is an active area of development, but some very useful tooling is available.

In the following we will explore using [LangChain agents](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/personal_assistants.html) with Prediction Guard LLMs to detect and automate LLM actions.

We will use LangChain again, but we will also use a Google search API called SerpAPI. You can get a free API key for SerpAPI [here](https://serpapi.com/).

```bash
$ pip install predictionguard langchain google-search-results
```

```python copy
from langchain.agents import load_tools
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent
from langchain.agents import AgentType
from langchain.llms import PredictionGuard
import os


os.environ['PREDICTIONGUARD_TOKEN'] = "<your access token>"
os.environ['SERPAPI_API_KEY'] = "<your serpapi api key>"
```

To setup an agent that will search the internet on-the-fly and use the LLM to generate a response:

```python copy
# In LangChain, "tools" are like resources that are available to your agent to
# execute certain actions (like a Google Search) while trying to complete a
# set of tasks. An "agent" is the object that you "run" to try and get a "Final Answer."
tools = load_tools(["serpapi"], llm=PredictionGuard(model="Neural-Chat-7B"))
agent = initialize_agent(tools, PredictionGuard(model="Neural-Chat-7B"),
                         agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)

agent.run("How are Domino's gift cards delivered?")
```

This will verbosely log the agents activities until it reaching a final answer and generates the response:
