# Prompt Injections

You can check for Prompt Injections from the `/injection` or `Injection` class in the Python client. This endpoint/Class takes two parameters:

- `prompt` - The prompt you would like to check for potential injections.
- `detect` - A boolean for whether you would like any injection to be scored and blocked. (Mainly used in the Completions/Chat endpoints).

The output will include a score from 0.0 to 1.0. The higher the score, the higher the probability of the checked prompt being an injection.
