# Completions

You can get controlled text completions from any of the [available models](../models) using a `/completions` endpoint or `Completion` class (similar to the OpenAI API).

The configuration of the `output` field/argument controls the output structure and type of the LLM. This is an optional field/argument, but is recommended. You can explore the options for configuring outputs [here](../output).
