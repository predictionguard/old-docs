# Proxy

The most core concept of Prediction Guard is that of the "proxy." You can think of a proxy as an easy-to-configure, 
and standardized, endpoint for predictions/ inferences. Instead of having to test out a bunch of state-of-the-art
models (with a variety of implementation concerns and inconsistent APIs), Prediction Guard allows you to create a 
"proxy" endpoint for your inferences by providing Prediction Guard examples of the model input/ output you want. 

Prediction Guard automatically uses your examples to search through its stable of SOTA models. Once Prediction Guard 
finds the "best" model for you, you can immediately call the proxy endpoint by name to start performing inference. There
is no need to maintain credentials to systems like OpenAI, co:here, Hugging Face, etc. Prediction Guard handles all that
under the hood so you can just focus on the behavior you need in your application.

  Prediction Guard uses serverless endpoints. You are NOT charged for CPU or GPU time, and there is no need to actively shut down your endpoints.

    # SOTA models to find the best one for your use case, and expose the best model
    # at an endpoint corresponding to the proxy.

The examples provided to Prediction Guard need to match a certain format defined by the "task." See [tasks](../tasks)
