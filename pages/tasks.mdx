# Supported Tasks

As of now, Prediction Guard supports the following tasks:

- Sentiment analysis - `sentiment`
- Question Answering - `qa`
- Machine Translation - `mt`

Coming soon (in the works):

- Speech-to-text (STT, ASR)
- Image Classification
- Textual Semantic Similarity

The examples you provide, when configuring a proxy endpoint, differ for each of these tasks. See below for examples.
