# Supported Tasks

As of now, Prediction Guard supports the following tasks:

| Task      | Label/ Name |  Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| Sentiment Analysis      | `sentiment`       | text in, sentiment label out |
| Question Answering   | `qa`        | question and context in, answer out |
| Machine Translation   | `mt`        | text in one language in, text in another language out |
| Text Generation  | `text-gen`        | prompt in, text completion out |
| Factual Consistency   | `fact`        | reference content and text in, label of factual consistency out |

Coming soon (in the works):

- Speech-to-text (STT, ASR)
