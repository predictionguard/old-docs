# Compliance

Prediction Guard's hosting of [controlled, open access LLMs](models) is both SOC 2 Type II and HIPAA compliant. However, to be fully HIPAA compliant, the Prediction Guard REST API (which is also used in the Python client) can then be hosted in your own infrastructure for full control and isolation of data input/outputs. This self-hosting of the API is part of our enterprise plan. 

[Contact us](support) for more information about enterprise hosting and support of our API.
